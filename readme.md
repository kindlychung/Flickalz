# Introduction

According to a recently [published paper in Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7632/full/nature20587.html), LED light flickering at 40Hz can reduce amyloid-Î² (main component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer patients) proteins in the brain almost by half. This project is a quick exploitation of that (very interesting) finding.

# Disclamation

It's free software, use at your own risk, don't blame me for any consequence of using it. But hey, it's a flickering window, how deadly a weapon could it be?

# Usage

Mac only.
Just download the Flickalz.app file on the release page and double click.
