# Introduction

According to a recently [published paper in Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7632/full/nature20587.html), LED light flickering at 40Hz can reduce amyloid-Î² (main component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer patients) proteins in the brain almost by half. This project is a quick exploitation of that (very interesting) finding.

# Disclamation

It's free software, use at your own risk, don't blame me for any consequence of using it. But hey, it's a flickering window, how deadly a weapon could it be?

# Usage

Mac only.
Just download the Flickalz.app.zip file [on the release page](https://github.com/kindlychung/Flickalz/releases), unzip it, and double click.

# Screenshot

Not an accurate depiction, but a gif is usually cute:

# Todo
- [ ] Customizable frequency
- [ ] Changing frequency according to time 
- [ ] Use a different UI so that the flickering is constantly visible (from the menu bar, for example)
